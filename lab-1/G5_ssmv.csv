ID,Talk
s1,you should just do update position. They set a block equal to
S2 (girl),where is it?
S1,the y position here
S3,so what is it doing is it
S3,because you're not updating the velocity
s1,"why don't you just set the y velocity before the simulation,"
s3,oh right
s3,huh?
s3,set y velocity before the simulation
s1,it doesn't do anything
s3,maybe update position doesn't do
s1,oh yeah you're right
s1,let's just not use that one
s3,so just do
s3,change y you have to change the y position by
s3,delta t times the velocity
s3,Or you can change to that because you have to change the x and y
s3,not yet right now we're just doing
s3,right now we're seeing if it can move up.
s3,"I mean, we're given an X and y grid on that so"
s1,there we go that's it
s1,so first let's do our if statements so let's stop it when it get's there. Let's do that first
s3,like if ugh if y position of our boat is equal to the y position of the dock
s2,oh no do greater than so that it can equal to that
s2,y position of. Yeah that one
s1,set of first
s3,dock
s3,stop simulation
s3,so that first so change
s1,we have to set our starting x velocity
s3,set y position too
s1,x&y position which should be there
s1,just do change or set
s2,what was it at before?
s3,or that
s2,oh yeah
s1,ok what if we open we open this again and see what it is
s3,so that would be 20.2
s3,no it should just be 20 right?
s2,no 20.2 because theres a 10.6 and 10.6
s3,right
s3,so 21.2 meters is the [indistinguishable]
s2,uhhh
s1,okay wait
s3,what are you doing? I'm kind of confused
s1,we don't need to know the width do we?
s3,"We should know the speed cause we are trying to like, correct for the speed. So like, if we're going 5 this way, and the river is taking us 2 this way."
s3,see what I'm saying?
s3,like we don't know our x position of velocity
s3,what
s3,cause it should be zero. Ideally.
s3,it stops at 7.9
s2,its okay. It cause of how we updated it.
s1,"yeah, so"
s1,"if that was a smaller number, it should be more exact."
s1,"Okay, so then should we should we should use"
s3,its 2 meters per second for how many seconds does it take to get across?
s1,what?
s1,we often need to figure out how long it takes to get across
s1,long. [indistinguishable] time.
s3,It depends
s3,okay so velocity is 2 point
s1,21:58
s3,itll get there in 10.65
s1,22:00
s3,the smaller you make this the closer it is going to get to
s2,22:07
s1,see I told it its not going to change the y
s3,yeah so we should just change the y
s3,22:34
s1,I'm just going to write down the kinematic equations
s3,22:37
s3,you don’t need kinematic equations
OS,22:41
s3,because you're starting at 5 meters per second and you're tryign to make it across. And you're just trying to see which angle it would go
OS,22:53
s3,how do we incorporate
OS,What are we solving for? To find the resultant speed we have to do the pythagorean theorem
s3,22:58
s2,I seriously don’t think the kinematic equations are going to help with this
s3,23:09
s1,"what is... what are we solving for what are we trying to find out, that’s what I don't understand."
s3,we're just trying to get across
OS,but for variable wise what are we solving for for
s3,we are trying to cross with the river pushing up
s3,23:21
s3,"Yeah, I know so what is that so we started this way and it"
OS,23:24
s3,was gonna push us this way. So like what is this like? Like the x
s3,23:31
s1,okay wait so if it is going to meters per second. How are you doing the math?
OS,23:36
s3,We don't know
s3,23:45
OS,I don't know exactly what we are solving for like he said like the theta thing
s3,23:51
OS,the angle
OS,23:55
s3,it outta be tangent
OS,23:59
s1,but like what did you use for your y?
s1,24:03
s1,The y was
s1,24:05
s1,five x or five over 2?
s3,so you're using speed not distance
s3,24:10
s3,No we are using… yeah we are using speed
s1,24:14
s3,Yeah that’s what I don't know like see
s3,24:18
s1,wouldn't it be distance? No wouldn't it be speed because you're trying to find it over distance
s3,24:19
OS,no you would have to know what position it would take you off of course
s3,24:31
OS,I think that thing right there
s1,its nothing
s3,24:40
OS,How do we incorporate the 2 meters per second
s1,24:43
OS,5 over 2. if we want to find the resultant speed we use the pythagorean theorem
s1,24:45
s3,"here’s the thing, if it takes, if its gonna be pushing us 2 meters per second in that direction we need to figure out how it takes to get across to figure out how it pushes us there"
s3,25:10
s3,Oh cause its in meteres per second
s1,25:15
s3,I guess we do have to use speed. I guess we would have to use speed because we have to find out how [indistinguishable]
s1,25:19
s3,its all we have
s3,we don’t know the x
s3,25:25
s3,so to find the angle what we need to do is find the angle of this
s1,the angle of that?
s3,the hyp….
s3,[indistinguishable]
s1,[indistinguishable]
s3,that’s not
s1,wait
s3,25:34
s3,are we trying to find? This one?
s1,yeah
s1,so…
s3,I can do this
s3,25:40
s1,So umm oh oh oh yeah its 2
s3,25:45
s1,Tangent is adjecent over
s3,25:48
s3,"No, it's opposite over adjacent"
s1,25:49
s3,SOCATOA so its opposite over adjacent
s3,25:55
s3,If you were doing tangent it would be opposite over adjacent but like look
s1,26:03
s1,"if you're actually trying to draw a triangle, you'd have to put this here instead. Because like if you're starting here, this isn't like your, this would be the adjacent side. This has nothing to do with the angle. We move that up here. Then if this is the angle we are solving for it would opposite over adjacent which would be 2 over 5"
s2,26:21
s1,see what I'm saying?
s3,26:26
s2,what would it be instead? 2 over 5?
s3,26:27
s1,5… it would be..
s3,2 right?
s1,I think it would be the tangent part of that
s3,yeah it would be 2 over 5
s3,26:28
s3,"yeah, it'll be 2 over 5… uhh the tangent of 2 over 5 right?"
s1,26:39
s2,I just changed the x velocity
s1,26:41
s2,"x would be...wait, no, no x velocity should be the speed of the river."
s2,Yeah
s3,26:46
s1,"Yeah, that's what it should have been."
s1,That’s how you make it change.
s3,26:51
s2,Yeah. And we have to counteract that in our simulation step.
s3,Yeah
s3,26:56
s1,And I'm gonna move it up to right here.
s3,"And it'll stop at the, it'll stop at the y"
s2,It'll still stop right there
s3,Yeah
s2,And it stops right where it should
s3,27:05
s2,So if we set the angle to uhh
s1,tangent of 2 over 5 is what we are going to use. That'll be our angle right?
s2,27:11
s2,err inverse angle
s1,27:16
s3,I think it would be inverse
s2,27:17
s1,its inverse tangent to find the angles right?
s3,yeah
s2,and tangent to find the side
s3,what?
s2,27:25
s2,"Inverse tangent find the angles, regular tangent just finds the sides"
s1,27:29
s2,so to find the angle we have to use inverse tangent of…
s1,27:31
s3,of 2 divided by 5
s2,27:37
s1,You can also do that here.
s2,27:42
s1,so 38 degrees. That’s our angle
s1,27:47
s3,"which makes sense, because..."
s1,27:58
s1,what did you guys get
s3,we got 23
s2,Did you guys use tangent or inverse tangent?
s3,we used tangent
s2,what?
s3,why would you use [indistinguishable]
s1,I thought tangent was just for side length
s3,28:02
s2,inverse tangent is for
s2,yeah inverse tangent for angles
s3,"ohh you're right, you're right we have to use inverse tangent"
s3,cause tangent like… yeah
s2,not side lengths
s2,28:12
s3,cause you have to use
s3,"yeah because if you have to use sides, you get radians"
s3,28:15
s1,tangent usually is in degrees
s3,28:18
s3,"If you use inverse tangent, it gives you a degree, we got 38. Just try"
s3,28:31
s3,What's the heading for this?
s2,[indistinguishable]
s3,wait I thought it was 2 over 5
s2,here I'll just show you what we did
s3,28:38
s3,so y over x
s1,28:41
s2,"So we were thinking, Okay, so like, this is our angle, right? So this is going"
s2,okay
s1,28:55
s3,"Oh, because…"
s1,28:57
s1,You're trying to make a triangle. So we put 2 over here
s2,that makes sense
s1,29:09
s2,What did you do the tangent of?
s3,29:12
s2,5 over 2 right? So…
s2,29:16
s1,Or we could do a division
s2,29:19
s3,and just say um x velocity of the river of y velocity
s1,29:27
s1,so this is more applicable.
s3,yeah I see what you're saying
s1,29:31
s1,So it's x velocity over y velocity
s2,29:35
s2,Yes. And then what we need to do…
s2,whoops
s1,29:40
s2,uhh then what we need to do uhh
s1,29:42
s1,But the opposite of that
s2,no I think we just add onto the heading
s2,29:52
s1,Why are you trying to find that?
s1,because its part of the question
s2,29:56
s1,Is it really?
s1,yeah it is
s1,what is it?
s2,29:58
s1,You can just use the graph to find that
s1,"yeah but we don’t have, you need to have variables."
s1,30:04
s2,you just have to check. You just have to check the variables
s1,[talking over each other]
s2,30:09
s1,You can also just  check the variables
s2,30:24
s1,okay just try that
s2,30:28
s1,that ought to make it go more
s2,okay good good
s2,that’s not good
s1,30:33
s1,That's good. That just means our boat is aiming the right way
s1,yeah
s2,30:36
s1,"Yeah, it's aiming like 30 degrees more or less. So it's gonna go straight,"
s2,"that’s has nothing to do with, its just like the angle of the boat"
s2,30:44
s3,so what we need to do now is change the velocities
s2,30:54
s3,by whatever it is
s2,30:58
s3,we have to find the velocity of this way
s2,that’s the opposite
s3,31:01
s3,so this is 38 degrees
s3,31:08
s3,we have to know the heading but we also need to know the velocity of that way
s3,that should be 38 degrees also
OS,31:17
s3,ueah I know but we have to find the velocity of this line
OS,okay just do the pythagorean theorem
s3,31:32
s3,so 5.4
OS,31:36
s3,so square root
OS,square root of 5 over 2 right?
s3,yes
s1,31:43
OS,why are you using multiplication
s3,31:46
s3,cause the square
OS,31:48
s3,why don't you just do like power
OS,31:57
s3,oh right
OS,32:00
s2,"No leave them, you need one of those"
s2,32:08
OS,I don’t know how that works though.
s3,I think its like power
OS,32:26
s3,"yeah to power of 2 and 5, power of 2 and 5"
OS,32:29
s3,"click it, click it"
OS,wait 5.39? It should be the square root of 29
s3,oh yeah right right right
OS,32:31
s3,We’re trying to find... I don’t even know what we are doing. We are trying to find the resultant velocity
OS,32:47
s3,Isn't there something like heading's velocity?
OS,heading is just the angle
s3,32:48
OS,Can't we just change the x velocity by negative 2? Set the x velocity to negative 2
s3,32:56
OS,The problem okay so now we know what our target is
s3,33:00
OS,its still going that way
OS,33:03
s3,so that's how fast it goes this way
OS,its still going that way
s3,33:05
OS,"This way,"
s3,33:07
s3,this can only be five meters per second  because we're going against the river so that means it's going to be slower. Yes.
s3,33:17
s1,Right?
s3,its still going that way
s2,33:20
OS,put that in the y velocity
s3,yeah that is where the y velocity is
OS,33:28
s3,but the y velocity won't affect whether it goes right or left
s2,33:32
s3,it only effects up and down right?
OS,33:41
s3,5 m/s
OS,no no she's right
s3,33:45
OS,if you put in the velocity of the river… you're not change the x velocity
s3,33:49
OS,The problem is how fast is it going across the river so you have to take into account you're using the two meters per second of your boat speed to go against it
s3,did you see that?
OS1,34:09
s3,in changing the velocity by 5.38
OS1,34:16
s3,so like we need to go this way but we can only go 5 m/s this way and take into account the 2 meters per second to counteract it.
OS1,34:25
s3,"So that’s what we have to do. We have to multiply this, change this by -1"
OS,34:48
s1,why are you using that?
OS,that’s what we want
s3,34:55
OS1,but now we have to uhhh
s3,no we just turned around the river
OS1,yeah
OS1,because..
s3,35:03
s3,yeah we have to show them canceling out. That's what I'm trying to figure out how to do. You can just set it to negative
OS1,35:11
s3,"wait. Okay, so then what you have to do is…"
OS1,35:16
s2,I totally don't know but
OS1,35:26
s3,here is x velocity
OS1,35:49
s3,nooo
OS1,[laughing]
s2,35:57
s3,we can’t change x velocity
s1,it's like a square root function
s3,okay wait I'm confused now
s1,it is a square root function cause we're using…
s3,ooo it starts going the right way but then it kind of curves
s2,"because of that one time, I'm doing that a bunch of times"
s3,36:00
s1,maybe we need to set it
s3,36:08
s3,I don't want to set it though
s1,yeah because if we set it…
s3,36:12
s3,just put that after it sets it
s1,36:13
s3,it's just gonna redefine… yeah its just going to redefine the thing. Here.
OS,okay
s3,36:19
OS,okay so relabel it.
s3,okay let me take this off
OS,36:26
s3,okay I'm just going to… why is the heading…
OS,set heading to our angle that we defined.
s3,that’s what we want
OS,36:33
s3,back to square one
s3,36:36
s3,and then just change that to change x velocity and then put it up higher
OS,above no above the second one
s3,36:44
s3,"Yeah, because we only want it to do that once"
s3,yeah
OS,yeah
s3,36:57
OS,why is our heading not?
s3,because you change x velocity
OS,37:03
s1,"but that was after we set the heading you see, we only set it once"
s3,maybe move that up higher
s3,you need to set velocity to x velocity of the river
OS,37:17
s3,what's the resultant velocity? I'm just curious
OS,37:32
s3,see that's whats wrong
OS,because that’s cause we took it out
OS,see [indistinguishable]
OS,yeah they are
s3,37:36
s3,but if the boat is still able... the boat shouldn't be going five meters per second up
s3,37:39
OS,that’s what I'm trying to figure out
OS,but it should
s3,37:41
OS,"but it shouldn't, if we did work against the river then that should take away from the boat's engine power"
s2,37:48
OS,"like instead of like, is that a part of your propeller is going this way and this is going straight this way"
OS,37:53
s3,your propeller this way so its not straight so you're using some of your speed but I don't know how you right that
OS,that’s the square root functions
s3,38:08
OS1,oh wait
s3,"Okay, changing it by the velocity every time so you're like doubling it or halving it"
OS1,38:14
OS,but I only want to do that once that’s the problem. Wait
s3,38:29
OS,you're going to have to set it before
s3,or you could do that…
OS,38:32
s3,can I see it real quick
OS,38:45
s1,wait I have an idea
OS,38:51
s1,I have an idea can I try something?
s3,that’s why it doesn't.. It doesn't set the heading because you have to set. Velocity isn't set before the heading is. So you have to…
s3,ohhh
OS,so its using the velocity from last
s3,38:52
01:13:46,let me just
OS,yeah go ahead but then I have an idea if I can remember it
s3,38:58
s3,here
OS,oh
s3,39:02
OS,Alright but we're still not getting that speed change
s3,yeah okay so what if…
OS,39:26
s3,we did this guy…
s3,39:29
OS,why are you adding an if statement?
s3,39:30
OS,is there a not equal?
OS,39:36
s3,yeah just put a not
s3,and the equal yeah
s2,39:40
s3,no you have to put the equal inside the not
s1,39:47
s3,"I have to go to the bathroom, I'll be right back"
s1,okay
s3,40:00
s3,what were you thinking?
s2,one second
s1,40:05
s3,"I'm not sure, I have an idea but its not quite [indistinguishable]"
s3,40:12
s1,I feel like this is right
s1,this is…
s3,40:16
s1,but that’s the same thing
[discussion with Dr. Biswas and the class],"yeah because it isn't 0, its 2"
NA,yeah its 2
NA,40:25
NA,right. Okay.
NA,the problem is if we are calling…
NA,40:33
NA,let me just see what the heading is
NA,40:55
NA,its not 21 degrees
NA,41:18
NA,what if we moved this… wait
NA,41:19
NA,the heading is not right
NA,41:37
NA,y'all had 22 didn't you? The first time you did it
NA,ooo wait wait can you flip these?
NA,wait why?
NA,because… now do it
NA,I want to see if it…
NA,its 68…
NA,yeah that’s not right
NA,41:42
NA,it's supposed to be 38 degrees
NA,41:45
NA,I think this is right
NA,41:48
NA,"supposed to be 38 degrees, but it's not"
NA,42:26
NA,Okay the thing is the velocity should be 0. that’s the goal.
NA,the x velocity should be 0 but
NA,yeah that’s the goal so its right
NA,42:30
NA,"lets ask, we've exhausted all our options so far"
NA,I think its right
NA,cause…
NA,42:38
NA,I don’t.
NA,42:42
NA,"first of all, the heading is not right."
NA,42:46
NA,I just think it’s the heading part you are starting it at 0 and then literally setting something right after it.
NA,43:08
NA,I'm going to see if we did something
NA,43:15
NA,wait [OS name] did you all get it?
NA,43:21
NA,okay sorry I just wanted to try something
NA,so I changed the river uh river's velocity and it worked.
NA,43:23
NA,what?
NA,43:24
NA,I changed the river's velocity to 10 and it still worked
NA,43:41
NA,yes because that's how we set it up.
NA,yeah. which is good
NA,43:46
NA,But I had an idea
NA,whoops
NA,yeah that’s too much
NA,43:48
NA,alright I have an idea
NA,"I know how to set the velocity, like the final velocity because of what we know."
NA,I need a pen
NA,44:03
NA,so like I just figure it out. So we are going this way right.
NA,44:11
NA,the angle you set it at
NA,"no not the angle, its like 38"
NA,44:14
NA,the heading angle has absolutely no effect on it.
NA,44:16
NA,No it doesn't but now I know how to control the speed. We know it should we know it can only go 5 m/s this way and we are forcing it to go 2 m/s this way so all we have to do it solve for this.
NA,44:25
NA,so we have like a squared plus wait 2 squared equals 5 squared or either way.
NA,44:32
NA,Wait ooo oo
NA,44:37
NA,all this is going to tell us is how fast its going straight.
NA,44:41
NA,no its already telling you how fast its going straight. Its going 5 m/s straight.
NA,44:45
NA,It shouldn't though because like if your boat is this way and you're putting all your propulsion straight back you'd get 5 m/s right? Right?
NA,44:47
NA,so you're saying the river's slowing down the boat
NA,44:53
NA,"the river is not going to slow down the boat whatsoever because the river is not flowing backwards, its flowing to the right."
NA,but if you’re having to counteract the force of the river technically there should be some like resistance.
NA,45:17
NA,"because like your boat's not pointed straight, its pointed this way, like you're not going straight your more like angled"
NA,45:20
NA,"saying the head angle, even if the boat is a head angle or this way, it's still going to move as if the heading like this way the head angle has no effect. It should, but it doesn't. But it doesn't. It's just coded. We're going to be negative."
NA,it should though
NA,but it doesn't
NA,but it should
NA,but it doesn't. its just coded weird.
NA,it should be negative.
NA,"No, no, no. I'm saying no, if you test it out it doesn't move in this direction."
NA,no yeah I know that.
NA,If its heading that way and you just change the y velocity.
NA,no I know that.
NA,45:50
NA,so basically what I'm saying is you have your angel right? It should be like 68.2 degrees
NA,45:54
NA,We got like 38 or something.
NA,45:55
NA,I don't know how you got 38 but okay.
NA,45:57
NA,Did you do tan inverse of 5 over 2?
NA,why? That’s wrong.
NA,46:01
NA,y over x
NA,46:08
NA,but its not though because like this is our triangle. This this and this. And this is our angle. So its opposite over adjacent. You see what I'm saying?
NA,46:16
NA,"Okay okay you're complicating it. Its not that complicated. 5 m/s, 2 m/s"
NA,it is.
NA,"Its not that complicated. 5 m/s, 2 m/s"
NA,yes so what's your triangle.
NA,46:24
NA,"Okay, okay, so basically like five to your triangle's right here. You're using this theta. So this is going to be like 5.4 tan inverse for 68 but that’s just for the degrees, the other thing isn't that complicated. So"
NA,yeah
NA,46:37
NA,"So, you know, you just have to counteract. what do you have to counteract? What is the only force that you have to counteract?"
NA,46:47
NA,the x velocity
NA,that's right
NA,how would you counteract that?
NA,in real life…
NA,yeah in real life but in this how would you counteract it?
NA,46:51
NA,you'd just subtract 2
NA,okay that’s all you have to do
NA,I know
NA,47:00
NA,"I'm fixing this, this has been bothering me"
NA,x velocity of the river
NA,whats 5 …
NA,47:04
NA,25 minus
NA,47:09
NA,so this would be the square root of 25
NA,okay wait
NA,47:12
NA,squared root of 25
NA,okay what is this for?
NA,47:15
NA,find the x y resultant velocity of the boat
NA,[indistinguishable]
NA,47:20
NA,i know we don't have to do it this way but
NA,47:27
NA,y velocity is always going to be 5
NA,what is 5.8
NA,the resultant is the hypotenuse right?
NA,yes which is 5 right?
NA,but it should be 5. see the problem. because the boat can only go 5 meters per second.
NA,47:41
NA,river is also added to the speed
NA,47:42
NA,but if you're going against the river
NA,47:46
NA,what are you talking about the speed or the time?
NA,the speed
NA,the speed is the square root of 21
NA,[indistinguishable]
NA,yeah
NA,I agree with you
NA,47:58
NA,wait how did you get the square root of 21?
NA,cause he's using the…
NA,48:06
NA,ohh cause you subtract two right? Okay.
NA,yeah you subtract the 2
NA,48:08
NA,Wait is the river not acutally doing anything? Its just a hypothetical
NA,yeah
NA,48:12
NA,why? Why would they give us that?
NA,48:15
NA,"All right, we could still do it."
NA,yeah its the same
NA,48:19
NA,so then we have to set the
NA,its still easy
NA,set the x velocity
NA,hold up how long is the river?
NA,48:24
NA,21 insh
NA,21.2 divided by 4.58.
NA,48:37
NA,So
NA,48:39
NA,"4.26, 4.26 seconds"
NA,okay
NA,48:43
NA,okay so what was the math there
NA,48:45
NA,do the square root
NA,oh yeah the square root of 20 while the square root of
NA,you have to put it in velocity
NA,48:53
NA,this is velocity
NA,no you have to put it in the y velocity.
NA,oh yeah yeah
NA,49:00
NA,that’s velocity right there
NA,yeah yeah
NA,ummm
NA,I think you have to take that off too
NA,why?
NA,I want to leave it here
NA,49:09
NA,its not x velocity equals 0
NA,if the x velocity is not 0
NA,49:13
NA,The resultant velocity has to be faster than 5 meters
NA,with the river
NA,49:17
NA,cause if its going against the river it has to go faster
NA,but it can't go that fast
NA,no it can
NA,why?
NA,x velocity is 5
NA,"the boat can only, the boat engine is 5 m/s"
NA,49:29
NA,"But I'm saying to overcome it you have to go faster. So what you did is this, right? You did negative two and then you do five and then this right?  but negative two squared is still 4."
NA,"Yeah, all right,"
NA,49:39
NA,"I know. You're correct, but you cant have negative velocity of the river, its always positive"
NA,49:41
NA,you can't.
NA,49:46
NA,"Right, right. I'm saying Either way, it's gonna be 5.4 is always resultant. Which doesn't make sense, correct."
NA,that why I'm fixing it.
NA,but the square root of 21 makes sense. It makes perfect sense.
NA,square root of 2 squared which was power of uhh we already did this didn't we?
NA,no I'm saying cause the river adds its velocity
NA,what?
NA,why are you doing? Why power
NA,50:20
NA,"lets just do this squared, x squared."
NA,50:22
NA,I'm pretty sure the resultant velocity is still 5.4
NA,50:28
NA,the boat can go at a maximum speed of 5
NA,50:34
NA,so realistically could never go 5.4 against the river cause you'd just subtract the difference. So you'd take that .4 and subtract it from 5 cause you're going against it.
NA,50:49
NA,which is how we got 4.6
NA,you have 4.6 as the resultant?
NA,50:52
NA,"Because you're right its 5.4 with the river, so that .4 subtracted since you're going against the river now gives you 4.6"
NA,51:02
NA,do you have.. could you do sin of um x?
NA,sin or inverse sin
NA,51:13
NA,sin of 4.6
NA,51:15
NA,sin of 4.6 equals x over 60. sin of 68 equals x over 4.6
NA,do sin of 68 times 4
NA,51:37
NA,its negative. Its negative 3.6
NA,this should be correct
NA,51:44
NA,wait x is what? X can't be that. See that’s why
NA,cause that means that youre one..
NA,but its not
NA,51:53
NA,now do um sin of 68 times 5.4.
NA,want me to get my calculator?
NA,51:59
NA,"See, how its closer to five."
NA,52:02
NA,"Because I'm saying is, buy your logic the x, The y velocity then isn't 5 anymore. It's 3.5."
NA,what? Why are you using sin?
NA,52:13
NA,"Okay, okay, imagine this. This is your triangle, right?"
NA,52:17
NA,"we took our boat here, started it at y, our dock is at 10.6"
NA,our dock is at 12
NA,52:29
NA,your dock? Oh
NA,I don’t know why
NA,52:35
NA,"[s3 name] Alright, so this is theta right? So this is 68.2 degrees right?"
NA,[indistinguishable]
NA,52:42
NA,"All right, so I'm saying the resultant velocity has to be 5 because you're saying this is 4.16?"
NA,uhhh speed wise?
NA,52:53
NA,"No, what is this? The resultant velocity. you're saying is it should be 4.6? It's not, its 5.4 because If this is y and this is x, right? So you agree that sine of 68.2 has to equal y over adjacent, over 4.6."
NA,opposite over hypotenuse
NA,"Right? So over here, ISo y equals sine of 68.2 times 4.6. Right? This should be equal, right?"
NA,53:23
NA,That's not 4.6. That's the
NA,53:24
NA,but you're saying it is
NA,no you're going this way is 4.6
NA,oh yeah yeah yeah the y is 4.6
NA,53:27
NA,That's where you're getting it wrong.
NA,53:31
NA,You're saying this is 4.6?
NA,yes and this is 5
NA,53:35
NA,but the y is 5
NA,53:37
NA,but the y isnt 5 because the y is how fast our boat is going
NA,53:40
NA,"let me show you this. So the way this is set up, our boat  needs to go this way, the river ges this way, and this is that angle. Correct?"
NA,Okay
NA,cause over here we are doing 2 meters per second up the river which is going in the same direction which means our results velocity is 5.4 meters per second.
NA,53:59
NA,right.
NA,54:01
NA,"if we are going in the opposite direction, so really its going not with the 2 meters per second, its going against the 2 m/s so realistically this should be and this should be and can only be 5 now."
NA,54:18
NA,so are you saying that it's going to go 4.6 this direction?
NA,this would be 4.6
NA,54:24
NA,"because because instead of, before this was only the x but now the hypotenuse is the speed now, because we are going against the river because our boat turned, instead of going straight our boat turned."
NA,54:41
NA,"Okay, I get what you're saying, like it's gonna like"
NA,54:44
NA,so you're using
NA,I got it I got
NA,54:48
NA,this would be theta and this would be negative 2 or 2 but you'd subract it and get
NA,that makes sense
NA,55:00
NA,great!
NA,so intense
NA,55:09
NA,wait its not right though
NA,it is
NA,its not
NA,why not
NA,run the simulation
NA,whats our boats y velocity? Why is it 5?
NA,55:17
NA,What's happening right now?
NA,55:19
NA,Okay just set the square root of the
NA,55:25
NA,of the y velocity
NA,but the y velocity
NA,[indistinguishable - talking over each other]
NA,55:27
NA,the y velocity
NA,why don't we set that at the end?
NA,55:31
NA,it has to change when
