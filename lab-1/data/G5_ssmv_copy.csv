ID,Talk
s1,you should just do update position. They set a block equal to
S2 (girl),where is it?
S1,the y position here
S3,so what is it doing is it
S3,because you're not updating the velocity
s1,"why don't you just set the y velocity before the simulation,"
s3,oh right
s3,huh?
s3,set y velocity before the simulation
s1,it doesn't do anything
s3,maybe update position doesn't do
s1,oh yeah you're right
s1,let's just not use that one
s3,so just do
s3,change y you have to change the y position by
s3,delta t times the velocity
s3,Or you can change to that because you have to change the x and y
s3,not yet right now we're just doing
s3,right now we're seeing if it can move up.
s3,"I mean, we're given an X and y grid on that so"
s1,there we go that's it
s1,so first let's do our if statements so let's stop it when it get's there. Let's do that first
s3,like if ugh if y position of our boat is equal to the y position of the dock
s2,oh no do greater than so that it can equal to that
s2,y position of. Yeah that one
s1,set of first
s3,dock
s3,stop simulation
s3,so that first so change
s1,we have to set our starting x velocity
s3,set y position too
s1,x&y position which should be there
s1,just do change or set
s2,what was it at before?
s3,or that
s2,oh yeah
s1,ok what if we open we open this again and see what it is
s3,so that would be 20.2
s3,no it should just be 20 right?
s2,no 20.2 because theres a 10.6 and 10.6
s3,right
s3,so 21.2 meters is the [indistinguishable]
s2,uhhh
s1,okay wait
s3,what are you doing? I'm kind of confused
s1,we don't need to know the width do we?
s3,"We should know the speed cause we are trying to like, correct for the speed. So like, if we're going 5 this way, and the river is taking us 2 this way."
s3,see what I'm saying?
s3,like we don't know our x position of velocity
s3,what
s3,cause it should be zero. Ideally.
s3,it stops at 7.9
s2,its okay. It cause of how we updated it.
s1,"yeah, so"
s1,"if that was a smaller number, it should be more exact."
s1,"Okay, so then should we should we should use"
s3,its 2 meters per second for how many seconds does it take to get across?
s1,what?
s1,we often need to figure out how long it takes to get across
s1,long. [indistinguishable] time.
s3,It depends
s3,okay so velocity is 2 point
s3,itll get there in 10.65
s3,the smaller you make this the closer it is going to get to
s1,see I told it its not going to change the y
s3,yeah so we should just change the y
s1,I'm just going to write down the kinematic equations
s3,you don’t need kinematic equations
s3,because you're starting at 5 meters per second and you're tryign to make it across. And you're just trying to see which angle it would go
s3,how do we incorporate
OS,What are we solving for? To find the resultant speed we have to do the pythagorean theorem
s2,I seriously don’t think the kinematic equations are going to help with this
s1,"what is... what are we solving for what are we trying to find out, that’s what I don't understand."
s3,we're just trying to get across
OS,but for variable wise what are we solving for for
s3,we are trying to cross with the river pushing up
s3,"Yeah, I know so what is that so we started this way and it"
s3,was gonna push us this way. So like what is this like? Like the x
s1,okay wait so if it is going to meters per second. How are you doing the math?
s3,We don't know
OS,I don't know exactly what we are solving for like he said like the theta thing
OS,the angle
s3,it outta be tangent
s1,but like what did you use for your y?
s1,The y was
s1,five x or five over 2?
s3,so you're using speed not distance
s3,No we are using… yeah we are using speed
s3,Yeah that’s what I don't know like see
s1,wouldn't it be distance? No wouldn't it be speed because you're trying to find it over distance
OS,no you would have to know what position it would take you off of course
OS,I think that thing right there
s1,its nothing
OS,How do we incorporate the 2 meters per second
OS,5 over 2. if we want to find the resultant speed we use the pythagorean theorem
s3,"here’s the thing, if it takes, if its gonna be pushing us 2 meters per second in that direction we need to figure out how it takes to get across to figure out how it pushes us there"
s3,Oh cause its in meteres per second
s3,I guess we do have to use speed. I guess we would have to use speed because we have to find out how [indistinguishable]
s3,its all we have
s3,we don’t know the x
s3,so to find the angle what we need to do is find the angle of this
s1,the angle of that?
s3,the hyp….
s3,[indistinguishable]
s1,[indistinguishable]
s3,that’s not
s1,wait
