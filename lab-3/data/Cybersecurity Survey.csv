6/14/2019 11:42:32,Male,Asian,12th grade,"The ability to move for a certain distance with one block would have probably been useful, but nothing major overall.",(Above) ability top move a certain distance,The tick counters were probably the most difficult because they required proficiency in several other block concepts coupled with knowing how to put them together.,"I tried to run the turn feature of the automated square program using ticks instead of time initially. I had to switch to a time based motion because when I used ticks, the degree of the turn varied drastically for each of the four motion. I think it did not work as well because the tick motion was more susceptible and vulnerable to the effect wheel slippage had on the process.",The hands on experience of being able to program an actual robot and see it work and fail instead of just a computer simulation was undoubtedly my favorite part.,Idk it was pretty good overall
6/14/2019 11:42:40,Male,White,12th grade,"Often times, the site itself would randomly stop working for me and my partner. ",,"The hardest parts to understand were the distributed system aspects, because I had trouble grasping exactly how the messages were sent and received by the robot, and how to use that information.","I think that some of my programs did not work due to small oversights in code, or a lack of full understanding about some of the concepts, which caused me to use things in an inefficient way.",I really enjoyed working with the robots.,
6/14/2019 11:42:45,Male,White,10th grade,Finding the Commands I needed/wanted to use,"an ""other than"" statement","I didn't have any trouble with concepts, only sometimes with execution, but even then, Ben (Instructor) knew what to do and showed me how to do what I wanted on NetsBlox","I think just mostly finding the blocks was the main challenge, a search bar for the command names and their descriptions would be very helpful.",On Thursday when we learned to encrypt and I had made a surefire brute force program.,The lectures.
6/14/2019 11:44:22,Female,White,10th grade,"Once we got further into the encryption programming, we encountered more difficulties in the code and we were forced to comb through every piece to find what the problem was.",I was satisfied with the features of NetsBlox that we used.,"The encryption/decryption programs were the hardest for me to understand because every detail had to be perfect, and I would often forget a piece.","We tried to create a program that would switch the numeric value of the encryption key every 10 milliseconds, but we soon realized that the key was changing too quickly and the robot couldn't keep up.",I enjoyed the competitions between groups and their robots.,The first day was the hardest because we didn't do anything with the robots.
6/14/2019 11:44:41,Male,White,11th grade,There are some limits as to how well you can detect other people and the strain on the computer was a limiting factor.,A more reliable app on the phone.,It all seemed easy and fluid.,Seemed fine in terms of what Netblox was able to accomplish.,Creating Mouse Control,Was generally pretty good. More food (at least my weight in food) would be appreciated. At least 150 pounds of food per day.
6/14/2019 11:47:08,Male,White,12th grade,"Some times the collaboration feature would not work for my partner or I at times. So only him or I, at times, would be able to work on the project while the other could not.",There is no feature that I can think of that should be added.,"The hardest concept was receiving messages and then doing different things with those messages. I was hard due to me not completely understanding it, and from me making some little mistakes here and there while coding.","I tried to make a ""testing"" key to figure out the enhanced Caesar (I think it was called figure) key. At times the code would stop running before it was done.",Getting to learn overall how cyber security works.,"Just random hiccups in my code, or the random times the signal to the bot stopped working."
6/14/2019 11:48:09,Female,Asian,12th grade,"If a large area of code needed to be moved elsewhere but the majority of the code is individual commands or functions, it takes time to move them all individually to a separate area. The program also crashes often and requires collaborators to move the code into a new project.","While block programming is helpful to beginners, it would be useful to be able to switch to text based programming to strengthen coding speed and knowledge for a continuous user.","Learning to try to hack others' programs is difficult because there is limited explanation on it. The main focus is on protecting the robot instead of attacking others, so those who are already comfortable with programming have an upper hand.","Placing beeps into a sequence is difficult because some beeps are skipped. The beeps could be playing in a faster sequence than visible in the program, but sometimes, it worked better than others.",The robot tug of war was my favorite part of the camp.,"The first day was only learning to program simple games, so it was boring."

Also, the programs wouldn't load at times.",Not anything I can think of at the moment.,"For some reason, I found the things with automated driving and basic encryption hardest. I'm not particulary sure why. I understand them if they're explained to me in person, but they were confusing at first. ",I tried to write some preliminary decryption code yesterday. It didn't work but probably just because I wasn't exactly sure how to do what I wanted.,"The competitions were fun. Also, the ability to interact with other groups and mess around with our robots to get to be able to do more things with them.",Probably the times I just stayed confused rather than asking questions. And some of our down time was too long for me to stay focused.

6/28/2019 10:42:20,Female,African/African-American,10th grade,"Sometimes the code would not connect to the robot, and we would have to shut down the robot continuously until it finally connected to the robot. ",No,The concepts most difficult to learn was hacking another person's program.,"Usually, it was because the robot and computer would not connect. I think this happened because the robots had to take time to connect to WiFi which may have taken more time then we originally thought.",My favorite part of camp was implementing the code we worked on in groups  to have some friendly competition with obstacle courses.,My least favorite part was the first day where we just copied the program that was on the board.

We were almost there but the program crashed as we were finishing. (Any changes we made would immediately disappear.)",Getting to try the different commands and finally getting the program to do what we wanted to.,"I liked the races, but they were stressful since we did not have many successful hacking scripts."
6/28/2019 10:44:10,Male,Asian,10th grade,when collaborating Netsblox would either be too slow or only let one person write. ,The program runs great the way it is ,How different blocks would join together and what that meant for specific scripts. ,Making attack codes were hard ever since encryption started. other than that we finished all that we wanted to do,"Working on the robots, i felt accomplished in our work. The food was great too. ",I enjoyed it all.

6/28/2019 10:45:44,Male,White,10th grade,There was sometimes a limit to something I would want to do that the program couldn't run,-,I had a very hard time dealing with very simple mistakes that had little to do with my actual code,"We entertained the idea of hacking on the last day, but it would be much too complicated for anything like it to work",being able to run any program that we were interested in pursuing,"day 2 felt very slow, but was not a bad experience"
6/28/2019 10:45:48,Female,Mexican-American ,10th grade,"Getting our robot to work, move/ corporate so that we could test to see if we were programming our robot correctly. Also having issues with blocks of code disappearing as we tried to drop it in. ",n/a,"encryption and decryption because although I understood what it did, the binary took a really long time before it actually began working. however a lot of it I found really difficult","Being able to get our root to go into a complete square, i'm not exactly sure why it didn't work but our ticks and performance form the robot didn't allow it to properly move. ",the first day mini-game as well as the competitions. ,Thursday 
6/28/2019 10:47:21,Female,White,10th grade,We had trouble collaborating using NetsBlox which made it challenging to code the robots. The program would often not let one person edit and would show different versions of the same project to different people.,Better collaboration settings ,I had trouble with decryption because I didn't understand which blocks to use and where to put them., I couldn't do the decryption because I didn't know how to do it.,The multiple races with our robots.,Decryption
6/28/2019 10:47:51,Female,White,9th grade,"Lack of knowledge of the kinds of blocks needed to accomplish certain tasks. I understood the logistics and concept of what we were trying to do, but when I asked proctors for help they merely reiterated these concepts and did not help me find what commands I needed to use.",Animation,"The coding itself and the use of new and unexplained blocks that were not understandable by common sense or assumptions. The proctors were not very helpful in explaining these blocks, some of which they did not mention or teach us how to use. These blocks were only shared when the class's two foremost groups shared their correct and sophisticated codes -- these groups had the personal attention of two of the proctors where the other groups were left behind.",Hacking into other's robots. My group could not figure out which blocks we needed to use and in what order due our lack of knowledge of the function of most of the blocks.,ROBOTS/driving the robots and programming the manual controls; racing.,"Frustration with my lack of understanding even after I had asked for help, and that no effort was made to ensure everyone understood each task after it was posed. "
6/28/2019 10:48:04,Female,White,10th grade,"Sometimes it was hard to collaborate using NetsBlox. A couple times the program would have an issue where somebody could not edit the program, and it had to be reopened.","I enjoyed playing around with the sounds, costumes, and backgrounds, but it would be fun to see more sounds and background. Also, I think there could have been tutorial courses so someone that did not participate in the Cybersecurity camp could access and use NetsBlox as well.","Decryption, for me, was probably one of the hardest concepts to understand. There is a lot of steps involved in stealing somebody else's key and then utilizing it. Additionally, there were a lot of different types of decryption, and I didn't really understand which was the best to use. ","Hacking was one of things we tried in our project, but had trouble getting it to work. It was hard to know exactly what was wrong with the program. We were thinking it might of not worked because of the sequence that kept changing.",My favorite part of the camp was using NetsBlox to create games and weather apps and other interactive programs.,"My least favorite part was creating the autonomous program for our robot; we tried using the timing method, but it was inconsistent."
6/28/2019 10:49:29,Prefer not to say,part White part Hispanic,10th grade,It lags a lot and I tend to have to restart the program alot,I would like to be able to use the normal commands with the robots,The messaging part and I Don't know,There were some basic errors in my coding that were easly fixed,playing with the the obstacle coarse,My commuter repeatedly crashing
6/28/2019 10:51:48,Female,White,10th grade,"It was somewhat confusing to use, and I didn't always understand exactly how to set the blocks up in a way that would make my code work. ","Some of the names on the blocks were confusing, but I don't believe there was much I would like to see changed. The font was really tiny, though, and very hard to see. ","I found figuring out how to set up the code in a way that our code would work to be the most confusing thing, and I got confused on what actually we were trying to achieve at certain points. ","Usually, my group found ways to get around things we could not do, but if there was something, we would ask for help figuring it out, and for the most part, the instructors were very helpful. ","The day we did encryption, because I felt like I understood that topic more than I understood anything else. The food was pretty good. ","I did not enjoy the day we worked on protecting our code (Wednesday, I believe) because I could not, for the love of God, figure out what we were doing and got very frustrate with myself and my group. Also, anything to do with the self driving stuff was frustrating, because no matter what, our code never seemed to work. "
6/28/2019 10:52:07,Female,Middle-Eastern ,10th grade,"NetsBlox is a great programming language; however, it may not be as great or as useful to first-time users with little to zero background knowledge on computer programming and/or computer science. The main problem I think is with NetsBlox is that most people struggled to know which sets of blocks to use or functions because they are not familiar with the language or where everything is set. ","Yes, for users with little to zero experience of computer programming, a manual should be included to describe the purpose of each block and a few examples on how they are used. ",I think the concepts of encryption and decryption were the most difficult to understand. ,"Oh, My partner(s) and I had several examples where things did not go as planned and it could be due to a minor issue such as reloading the page or forgetting to include the number of the robot. ","My absolute favorite part of the camp was all of the amount of hacking we did on  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I enjoyed the hacking because I felt like our classroom had been transformed to a hacking and cyber security facility, where everyone was so involved at this top secrecy level. ",I really did enjoy the camp and I do not think there was any part of the camp that I did not enjoy. Thank you for such an amazing week! 
6/28/2019 11:26:55,Male,Hispanic,10th grade,Sometimes the NetsBlox would not let us collaborate with each other.,,"The most difficult to understand concept was the encryption aspect, especially the modifies caesar cypher.",,"My favorite part was the fact that we could collaborate with our peers, as this allowed us to get much more done in less time.",
