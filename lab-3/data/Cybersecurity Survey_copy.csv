8,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Finding blocks, inviting people, staying in sync with people in the same program, network issues, netsblox not allowing you to edit and you having to restart the tab."
9,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"The ability to move for a certain distance with one block would have probably been useful, but nothing major overall."
10,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Often times, the site itself would randomly stop working for me and my partner. "
11,1,challenges_NetsBlox,Finding the Commands I needed/wanted to use
12,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Once we got further into the encryption programming, we encountered more difficulties in the code and we were forced to comb through every piece to find what the problem was."
13,1,challenges_NetsBlox,There are some limits as to how well you can detect other people and the strain on the computer was a limiting factor.
14,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Some times the collaboration feature would not work for my partner or I at times. So only him or I, at times, would be able to work on the project while the other could not."
15,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"If a large area of code needed to be moved elsewhere but the majority of the code is individual commands or functions, it takes time to move them all individually to a separate area. The program also crashes often and requires collaborators to move the code into a new project."
16,1,challenges_NetsBlox,Lag
17,1,challenges_NetsBlox,
18,1,challenges_NetsBlox,It was challenging to find some blocks
19,1,challenges_NetsBlox,understanding what each block does without thorough indtruction
20,1,challenges_NetsBlox,Sometimes you could unsync with your partners 
21,1,challenges_NetsBlox,I had trouble finding a way to express what I wanted to program 
22,1,challenges_NetsBlox,It took some time getting used to creating custom blocks
23,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Finding specific blocks that weren't used many times, REALLY HARD TO FIND SOMETIMES"
24,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"My computer's interactions with netsblox often resulted in issues that caused me to need to reload the program or all of google because I couldn't edit or something like that. Also, the programs wouldn't load at times."
25,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Sometimes, it wouldn't let me edit and was just lagging. My group member's dit wouldn't show up."
26,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Sometimes the code would not connect to the robot, and we would have to shut down the robot continuously until it finally connected to the robot. "
27,1,challenges_NetsBlox,glitches. needs to improve intuitive
28,1,challenges_NetsBlox,Server not always reliable; blocks of script known to work in Scratch did not yield the same results (or any at all); problems with saving or editing
29,1,challenges_NetsBlox,when collaborating Netsblox would either be too slow or only let one person write. 
30,1,challenges_NetsBlox,My groups robot did not move and it was a challenge trying to figure out why and how to fix it.
31,1,challenges_NetsBlox,There was sometimes a limit to something I would want to do that the program couldn't run
32,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Getting our robot to work, move/ corporate so that we could test to see if we were programming our robot correctly. Also having issues with blocks of code disappearing as we tried to drop it in. "
33,1,challenges_NetsBlox,We had trouble collaborating using NetsBlox which made it challenging to code the robots. The program would often not let one person edit and would show different versions of the same project to different people.
34,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Lack of knowledge of the kinds of blocks needed to accomplish certain tasks. I understood the logistics and concept of what we were trying to do, but when I asked proctors for help they merely reiterated these concepts and did not help me find what commands I needed to use."
35,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"Sometimes it was hard to collaborate using NetsBlox. A couple times the program would have an issue where somebody could not edit the program, and it had to be reopened."
36,1,challenges_NetsBlox,It lags a lot and I tend to have to restart the program alot
37,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"It was somewhat confusing to use, and I didn't always understand exactly how to set the blocks up in a way that would make my code work. "
38,1,challenges_NetsBlox,"NetsBlox is a great programming language; however, it may not be as great or as useful to first-time users with little to zero background knowledge on computer programming and/or computer science. The main problem I think is with NetsBlox is that most people struggled to know which sets of blocks to use or functions because they are not familiar with the language or where everything is set. "
39,1,challenges_NetsBlox,Sometimes the NetsBlox would not let us collaborate with each other.

76,2,other_features_NetsBlox,I would like to be able to use the normal commands with the robots
77,2,other_features_NetsBlox,"Some of the names on the blocks were confusing, but I don't believe there was much I would like to see changed. The font was really tiny, though, and very hard to see. "
78,2,other_features_NetsBlox,"Yes, for users with little to zero experience of computer programming, a manual should be included to describe the purpose of each block and a few examples on how they are used. "
79,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"Probably brute force decryption; I either didnâ€™t spend enough time on this, made it too complicated or both"
80,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,the use for certain blocks
81,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,The most difficult to understand was the encryption breaking. It seemed complex to me.
82,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,the encryption

85,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,
86,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"the robot encryption, i got lost easily"
87,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,The tick counters were probably the most difficult because they required proficiency in several other block concepts coupled with knowing how to put them together.
88,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"The hardest parts to understand were the distributed system aspects, because I had trouble grasping exactly how the messages were sent and received by the robot, and how to use that information."
89,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"I didn't have any trouble with concepts, only sometimes with execution, but even then, Ben (Instructor) knew what to do and showed me how to do what I wanted on NetsBlox"
90,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"The encryption/decryption programs were the hardest for me to understand because every detail had to be perfect, and I would often forget a piece."
91,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,It all seemed easy and fluid.
92,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"The hardest concept was receiving messages and then doing different things with those messages. I was hard due to me not completely understanding it, and from me making some little mistakes here and there while coding."
93,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"Learning to try to hack others' programs is difficult because there is limited explanation on it. The main focus is on protecting the robot instead of attacking others, so those who are already comfortable with programming have an upper hand."
94,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,Cleaning up the code because I don't like cleaning up.
95,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,Custom keys
96,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"I did not understand how to communicate in chat rooms or why certain things, such as ticks, were important."
97,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"decryption, I don't really follow how it works , especially with the binary code"
98,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,The coding for Hacking other people didn't make much sense to me
99,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,list operations
100,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,Encrypting and Decryption
101,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"encryption and decryption, probably because there were lots of words and I am a visual learner"
102,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"For some reason, I found the things with automated driving and basic encryption hardest. I'm not particulary sure why. I understand them if they're explained to me in person, but they were confusing at first. "
103,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,Knowing what blocks to use to reach our goal. 
104,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,The concepts most difficult to learn was hacking another person's program.
105,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,decryption
106,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,I was a bit unclear with the types of defenses that we could implement. 
107,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,How different blocks would join together and what that meant for specific scripts. 
108,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,almost everythinh 
109,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,I had a very hard time dealing with very simple mistakes that had little to do with my actual code
110,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"encryption and decryption because although I understood what it did, the binary took a really long time before it actually began working. however a lot of it I found really difficult"
111,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,I had trouble with decryption because I didn't understand which blocks to use and where to put them.
112,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"The coding itself and the use of new and unexplained blocks that were not understandable by common sense or assumptions. The proctors were not very helpful in explaining these blocks, some of which they did not mention or teach us how to use. These blocks were only shared when the class's two foremost groups shared their correct and sophisticated codes -- these groups had the personal attention of two of the proctors where the other groups were left behind."
113,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"Decryption, for me, was probably one of the hardest concepts to understand. There is a lot of steps involved in stealing somebody else's key and then utilizing it. Additionally, there were a lot of different types of decryption, and I didn't really understand which was the best to use. "
114,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,The messaging part and I Don't know
115,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"I found figuring out how to set up the code in a way that our code would work to be the most confusing thing, and I got confused on what actually we were trying to achieve at certain points. "
116,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,I think the concepts of encryption and decryption were the most difficult to understand. 
117,3,concepts_difficult_understand_why,"The most difficult to understand concept was the encryption aspect, especially the modifies caesar cypher."

119,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,My decryption program for hacking into the square driving program. I made it too complex and messed up the variables
120,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,encryptions and trying to get the robot to beep
121,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,I tried some more complex encryption and it didn't work at first. I was just not coding it right.
122,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,the code was broken
123,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,if it did not work it was because the robot was unresponsive
124,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,trying to make it do. perfect circle was very difficult 
125,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,
126,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,Everything we have tried to implement has worked so far
127,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"I tried to run the turn feature of the automated square program using ticks instead of time initially. I had to switch to a time based motion because when I used ticks, the degree of the turn varied drastically for each of the four motion. I think it did not work as well because the tick motion was more susceptible and vulnerable to the effect wheel slippage had on the process."
128,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"I think that some of my programs did not work due to small oversights in code, or a lack of full understanding about some of the concepts, which caused me to use things in an inefficient way."
129,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"I think just mostly finding the blocks was the main challenge, a search bar for the command names and their descriptions would be very helpful."
130,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"We tried to create a program that would switch the numeric value of the encryption key every 10 milliseconds, but we soon realized that the key was changing too quickly and the robot couldn't keep up."
131,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,Seemed fine in terms of what Netblox was able to accomplish.
132,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"I tried to make a ""testing"" key to figure out the enhanced Caesar (I think it was called figure) key. At times the code would stop running before it was done."
133,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"Placing beeps into a sequence is difficult because some beeps are skipped. The beeps could be playing in a faster sequence than visible in the program, but sometimes, it worked better than others."
134,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,The hacking program didn't work and I think it was because the encryption was too hard to break for us.
135,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,
136,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"I tried to break a 4-digit Ceasar shift, which did not work at first because I put some blocks into the wrong loop."
137,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,I don't have a memorable experience of that 
138,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,We couldn't get our robot to follow the ticks and go around the square. I think it didn't work because we didnt measure our ticks correctly and didn't understand what to do
139,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,I was able to do all exercises
140,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,Everything we tried to do we eventually were able to accomplish
141,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"I sort of struggled with the decrypting others robots, mainly because it was really hard to crack the code"
142,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,I tried to write some preliminary decryption code yesterday. It didn't work but probably just because I wasn't exactly sure how to do what I wanted.
143,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"knowing what blocks to use to reach our goal. I understand what I need to do, but don't know what steps to take."
144,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"Usually, it was because the robot and computer would not connect. I think this happened because the robots had to take time to connect to WiFi which may have taken more time then we originally thought."
145,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,netsblox overloaded with too much programming
146,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"We attempted to make it so that the client rate we set did not interfere with our own commands, but were unsuccessful. We were almost there but the program crashed as we were finishing. (Any changes we made would immediately disappear.)"
147,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,Making attack codes were hard ever since encryption started. other than that we finished all that we wanted to do
148,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,Our robot did not like moving or cooperating with the program but it was usually because either one of our computers got disconnected from it or the robot wasnt connected to wifi.
149,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"We entertained the idea of hacking on the last day, but it would be much too complicated for anything like it to work"
150,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"Being able to get our root to go into a complete square, i'm not exactly sure why it didn't work but our ticks and performance form the robot didn't allow it to properly move. "
151,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why, I couldn't do the decryption because I didn't know how to do it.
152,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,Hacking into other's robots. My group could not figure out which blocks we needed to use and in what order due our lack of knowledge of the function of most of the blocks.
153,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"Hacking was one of things we tried in our project, but had trouble getting it to work. It was hard to know exactly what was wrong with the program. We were thinking it might of not worked because of the sequence that kept changing."
154,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,There were some basic errors in my coding that were easly fixed
155,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"Usually, my group found ways to get around things we could not do, but if there was something, we would ask for help figuring it out, and for the most part, the instructors were very helpful. "
156,3,tried_ but_couldnot_what_Why,"Oh, My partner(s) and I had several examples where things did not go as planned and it could be due to a minor issue such as reloading the page or forgetting to include the number of the robot. "

193,4,favorite_part_camp,"The day we did encryption, because I felt like I understood that topic more than I understood anything else. The food was pretty good. "
194,4,favorite_part_camp,"My absolute favorite part of the camp was all of the amount of hacking we did on  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I enjoyed the hacking because I felt like our classroom had been transformed to a hacking and cyber security facility, where everyone was so involved at this top secrecy level. "
195,4,favorite_part_camp,"My favorite part was the fact that we could collaborate with our peers, as this allowed us to get much more done in less time."

219,5, least_favorite_part_camp ,Probably the times I just stayed confused rather than asking questions. And some of our down time was too long for me to stay focused.
220,5, least_favorite_part_camp ,decryption because it's hard to understand what to do. 
221,5, least_favorite_part_camp ,My least favorite part was the first day where we just copied the program that was on the board.

232,5, least_favorite_part_camp ,"I did not enjoy the day we worked on protecting our code (Wednesday, I believe) because I could not, for the love of God, figure out what we were doing and got very frustrate with myself and my group. Also, anything to do with the self driving stuff was frustrating, because no matter what, our code never seemed to work. "
233,5, least_favorite_part_camp ,I really did enjoy the camp and I do not think there was any part of the camp that I did not enjoy. Thank you for such an amazing week!
